## Quick Note 📝

I have included a [💡 tips file](TIPS.md). It contains trips & tricks which make my life & project a bit easier.

## Resources used 💿

1. Vite + React + Typescript & Tailwind CSS
2. Firebase (Hosting & Storage) + Google ReCaptcha (AppCheck in Firebase & Site Protection)

### V-R-T Stack with Tailwind CSS

[ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev) is a library of happiness in disguse. ViteJS uses Rollup for "packing & building" a site, which alone is excellent.  Vitejs flaunts a HMR (Hot Module Replacement 🔥) feature, without a loss in state 🤯. It has open-source scaffolding for almost all popular front-end stacks (like React, Svelte and even VanillaJS & VanillaTS). It is my go to choice for all projects 😍.

[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) is a library, I work with professionally 🤝🏻. I do not hate Vue or Svelte etc, by there is something comfortable 🛌🏻 for me working with ReactJS. I would not argue it has plenty room for improvement 🤔 (and should be inspired from Next.js).

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is one of the libraries I personally hated 🤧. Over time ⏳, I have realized 🤔 that extra piece of work 💧 I have to do ahead during development saves me from bugs 🐛. I am even more productive ⚒ with Typescript, than without.
P.S. It saves me from lot of embarrassment 😳 ahead of time 🙉.

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is one of my favourite ❣ inline style builder 🧱. The range of utility classes predefined & flexibility🤺 is mind-blowing 😵.

### Why did I use Firebase 🔥?

I have been using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for a long time now as a BaaS. Firebase has it's pros 🙂 and cons 😕, yet it is a strong contender 💪🏻 in the field of BaaS providers.

#### Hosting

In my experience my **Firebase Hosting** 🌐 is quite fast and easy to deploy, with the free domains `*.web.app` and `*.firebaseapp.com`. The Firebase CLI 👨🏻‍💻 makes it extremely fast to deploy the same 🚀. Before utilizing the main resources we can use a _temporary preview_ channel to get a feel of the site in a real-world domain 😮 (not merely localhost where everything works and then breaks 🙄).

#### Storage

On the other hand, I am using **Firebase Storage** 🗄 as a Content Delivery Network for my assets 🖼. Secured by rules 🛤 my specific bucket 🧺 (here _birthday_) is secure 🔐 from manipulation and can be read 👀 by everyone. Morever it is protected 🛡 by a token which is only generated if the request originates for _whitelisted origins_ 📃. I can speak from my experience **Storage** in **GCP** is quite fast 💨 (may be not the fastest) and get's my job done ✅.

#### AppCheck

**AppCheck by Firebase** is just a feature to verify 🧐 all requests that originates for Firebase Resources (like Firestore, Storage, Functions etc...), are from _whitelisted origins_ 📃. These origins are controlled seperately in the **Google ReCaptcha V3** settings and the same secret ReCaptcha Key 🤫 is shared with Firebase. On the other hand 🤟🏻, the client (i.e. your browser 🕸 & my app 📱) knows the _public/site key_ 🗣. By knowlege 📚 (and high level stuff 🌊), we know Google secures misuse 🤐 resources.

### Uses of ReCaptcha V3 Badge

In particular that part could be really be skipped 😑. This site (or any other site using AppCheck) does not need any ReCaptcha Badge Protection 🛡. As I did not include ❎ a privacy policy, this is my way of declare 🗣, the site used ReCaptcha.

### Alternatives of Firebase

1. For hosting a static site you may continue with:
   - [Github](https://github.com) [Pages](https://pages.github.com) \[Experienced. Demo: [https://anrcry.github.io](https://anrcry.github.io)\]
   - [Render](https://render.com/) \[Never Tried\]
   - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) \[Partially tried. Very Fast 🏁\]
   - [Vercel](https://vercel.app) \[Partially tried. Very Fast 🏁\]
   - [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) \[Never tried\]
   - [Coolify.io](https://coolify.io/) \[Never tried\]
   - [Backendless](backendless.com) \[Never tried\]
2. For cloud storage for free, you may try 
    - AWS S3 (Free Tier) \[Never tried\]
    - [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage) \[Partially tried. No comments 🤐\]
    - [nhost.io Storage](https://nhost.io/) \[Never tried\]
    - [Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/) \[Never tried\]
    - [Backendless](backendless.com) \[Never tried\]

## Discussion

I would someday 📅 like to further develop this with an admin 👩🏻‍💻 panel or something of that sort. That way I could issue random links 🔗 for each of my friends. Their details (name, email and phone number) will be filled ✍🏻 in dynamically.

### Partial TODO 🟨

- [x] Partial SSR to create custom greetings.

### TODO Map 📍

- [ ] ⭐🔴 Add my social links to the birthday site pointing to myself... 🖱
- [ ] 🔴 Know your audience:
  - [ ] Add a custom popup, to send a message to us directly (with feeback). If the user is known (due to dynamic link, no name is required).
  - [ ] ⚠ **Server Side**: Curating the feedback/message from the user to improve/thank them later.
- [ ] 🟡 Admin Panel to make stuff dynamic.
- [ ] 🔵 Dynamic URL linking (Optional)
- [ ] 🟡 ⚠ **Server Side**: [**CRON**](https://crontab.guru) job to read Firestore once everyday at 0️⃣0️⃣:0️⃣0️⃣ (_IST_), to send out SMS and/or email via API with birthday greetings.

> 🔴 - High Priority
>
> 🟡 - Medium Priority
>
> 🔵 - Low Priority
>
> ⚠ - Probably Server Side
>
> ⭐- Currently working on this.
